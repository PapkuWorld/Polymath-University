I am going to teach my friends how to become the ultimate polymath. This program spans 20 years and will help you become a better version of yourself. It's for both men and women. trans, etc., as long as you are physically and mentally capable of performing the tasks. If you are physically  or/and mentally disabled, there will be another path based on that here that u can substitute things here. I made this guide in my own image because I have been struggling with Paranoid Schizoprenia, Biopolar Disorder Type 1, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, Dissociative Identity Disorder, and Autism Level 1. I got diagnosed with all these illnesses after getting gangstalked by different beings for months.


# How my mental illnesses affect me:

### Paranoid Schizophrenia
* Hearing Voices and seeing things that are not real
* Having extreme paranoia
* Hard time sleeping because of nightmares and insomnia
* Delusions that take over the life

### Bipolar Disorder Type 1 
* Mania makes me stay up for hours and do a lot of things
* Depression makes me feel really down and sad 
* Unstable Creativity 

### Obsessive Compulsive Disorder 
* Checking locks, stoves, sinks, and pockets multiple times, 
* fixated on a thought sometimes, it keeps repeating inside my head 
* Need to have things in semi-perfect order, or else I am not satisfied

### General Anxiety Disorder 
* Scared of most people when going outside 
* when walking behind someone or over bridges, feeling scared 
* uncontrollable walk path to the destination

### Autism Level 1 
* Sensitive to High-Pitched Sounds  
* Extremely Slow Learner
* Diverse interests in Technology-Related Things
* Group Social Gatherings problems

### Dissociative Identity Disorder
* Having temporary blackouts, and it feels like someone else took over 
* Extreme Memory Problems 
* Remember past trauma and going into a cycle of sadness and anger
* 8 alters that I don't remember who they are 






# Mental Health Fix
* Take Medication as my doctor recommended  
* Practice Meditation and Mindfulness 
* Fitness fixes make me less depressed 
* Stop worrying, nothing is going to happen 
* Sleep whenever u feel like, hard to sleep due to nightmares
